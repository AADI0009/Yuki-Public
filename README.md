## This repo will likely to remain close-source. Archives will be posted in this repo.

## ▶ Yuki Source Code

The source code for the bot was under recode. I will make it for dummies.
(And also the website is will be live with the code).


## ▶ Setup
First, rename config.json.example to config.json. Do not host on GitHub.

## ▶ Self-Hosting
Meanwhile, you can self-host the bot but there is some exepections:
 * Please credit the author behind the code, or have a specific command to notify your users that you have self-hosted Yuki in any shape or form.
 * Do not claim the code that it was made by you, or not the original creator (me aka SplitXPlayZ).
