## ▶ Milestone 1 Beta Source Code

Welcome to Yuki's github page. In this page you can see the code behind Yuki.


## ▶ Before Install
You need to install [node](https://nodejs.org) on your computer, and you also need access to the VPS/computer you are going to self-host on.

## ▶ Installation
Linux Systems:

These commands below will fix the `integer` bug, otherwise without this you cannot install it normally, due it will try to install **1.0.7** instead of **4.0.0**!
```
npm i -g npm-check-updates
npm-check-updates -u
npm install
```

## ▶ Self-Hosting (Support)
You must use **Node 16.6** to get it installed, otherwise the bot will refuse to start, self-hosting for this milestone does have support so join our support server if there is any issues while you encounter using this test milestone.
