## ▶ Yuki Source Code

The source code for the bot was under recode (and still is). I will make it for dummies.
(And also the website is will be live with the code).


## ▶ Setup
First, rename config.json.example to config.json. Do not host on GitHub (if can even host it under private repos).

## ▶ Self-Hosting
Meanwhile, you can self-host the bot but there is some exepections:
 * Please credit the author behind the code, or have a specific command to notify your users that you have self-hosted Yuki in any shape or form.
 * Do not claim the code that it was made by you.


## ▶ Archives
Click [archives](https://github.com/yukidiscordbot/Yuki-Public/tree/archives) to get the old version and codes behind Yuki.
Follow the **LICENSE** on that tree.

**Warning**: The old archives can be unstable and confirmed that it wasn't working at the moment. (temporary fix will be added soon)
