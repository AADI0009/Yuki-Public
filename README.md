## Anti-Piracy Methods
Yar-har!
There is a hidden module in the archives to help your bot keep out on any listing server, good luck finding them. :). You are still allowed to edit/modify, and do anything to these **BUT!** You need to credit the author (me) atleast put something like "powered by yukibot.xyz". These piracy methods ONLY WORKS at listing discord servers. Unless, if i give permission to remove these hidden codes.

## Greetings
Welcome to the archives of Yuki, you can see here the code behind Yuki from older versions.

**WARNING**: You need to follow the `LICENSE` and agree with it, please note that:
**You will receive no support for a old version, it is a archive not a up-to-date version.** But!
You will get a custom rare role for yourself.
